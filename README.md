Experimental view generator for the [geddy.js](http://geddyjs.org) MVC framework.

This generator is currently purely experimental and should not be used.

1. Clone the [geddy generator-revamp branch](https://github.com/geddy/geddy/tree/generator-revamp) in your local node_modules folder under geddy-gen-revamp/ or similar.
2. Create a simlink named "geddy-gen-revamp" to the geddy-generator-revamp/bin/cli.js in your /bin folder.

Then run:

    $ geddy-gen-revamp gen view help

and follow further instructions.
